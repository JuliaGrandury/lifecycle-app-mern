<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I grew up wearing hand-me-downs for most of my life and only discovered the power and joy that I could find in clothing when entering adulthood. Before then, I had never attributed much value or interest to the way I dressed so when I did, I quickly realized how unsustainable it could be both financially and environmentally.
The 2.5 trillion clothing industry has a huge problem with pollution, waste, and human rights abuses. For the many of us that care about our planet and hope to see us all move towards a more sustainable and fair world. If these reasons do not motivate you, perhaps the financial aspect will. By tracking your clothing, you can avoid breaking the bank while still expressing yourself through fashion.

Lifecycle is meant to help users organize and keep track of what they own in order to avoid unnecessary purchases. Not only that but it is also meant to encourage and facilitate swaps and exchanges of clothing between friends and family. The philosophy behind it is fouded on the fact that humans are attracted to novelty. Our midbrain (particularly the substantia nigra/ventral segmental area) responds to novel stimuli by directly activating the dopaminergic system in our brain. In other words, novelty makes us feel good. But we don't need to buy new clothes in order to produce that reaction. Borrowing an item from a friend's closet or lending an item, forgetting about it and then getting it back a couple of weeks later can produce the same reaction. Absence makes the heart grow fonder and sometimes that is all we need to want to wear our favorite items again. 

TLDR - LifeCycle allows users to partake in fashion in a sustainable manner for the planet and their wallets. Features include:
- Creating an account and logging in
- Uploading one's closets to the app
- Sharing your closet virtually with a circle of friends
- Submitting borrow or swap requests to friends
- Tracking items that are "out of closet" for loans or repairs
- Adding a wishlist of items their circle can view
